Article I

THE SHARE PURCHASE

1.1 The Share Purchase.

(a) Company Shares. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall sell and transfer to Parent, or at Parent’s direction, Acquirer, at the Closing, and Parent, or at Parent’s direction, Acquirer, agrees to purchase from the Sellers, all of the Company Shares as of immediately prior to the Closing, free and clear of all Encumbrances and with all rights then attaching to them, including the right to receive all distributions and dividends declared, paid, made or accruing on or after the Closing, in exchange for (i) an amount in cash (rounded down to the nearest cent), without interest, equal to the Closing Cash Consideration, less the Deposited Amount; (ii) a number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the Closing Stock Consideration, less the Escrow Amount withheld pursuant to Section 9.1; (iii) the Contingent Consideration (if and to the extent payable pursuant to Section 1.3); and (iv) any portion of the Escrow Amount released to the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.1, in each case, subject to any amount withheld pursuant to Section 1.1(b).

(b) Withholding. Each of Parent, Acquirer, the Company, the Sellers and any applicable Affiliate of Parent, Acquirer, the Company or the Sellers (each, a “Payor”) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Payor determines are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other Applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid or remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with Applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. Except with respect to payments in the nature of compensation, if a Payor determines that an amount is required to be deducted and withheld, such Payor shall provide the payee with (a) commercially reasonable notice of the Payor’s intent to deduct and withhold, which shall include a copy of the calculation of the amount to be deducted and withheld, and (b) a reasonable opportunity for the payee to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding (or reduce such withholding).

 

2

(c) Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Share Purchase (the “Closing”), shall take place at the London offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, which are located at 99 Bishopsgate, London, EC2M 3XF, United Kingdom at (i) 10:00 a.m. United Kingdom time on the first Business Day of Parent’s fiscal quarter following the fiscal quarter in which all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are intended to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions); provided, that, if the date on which all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are intended to be satisfied at the Closing) is less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the end of Parent’s fiscal quarter in which such date occurs, then either Parent or SoftBank may, with written notice to the other party, delay the Closing until the first Business Day of the second fiscal quarter following such date (so long as all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are intended to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall continue to be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement on such Business Day), or (ii) such other date and time and/or such other location as Parent and the Sellers agree in writing; provided, however, that in no event shall the Closing take place earlier than October 1, 2021. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the “Closing Date”.

1.2 Payment of Consideration.

(a) Cash Payments and Parent Stock Issuance.

(i) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement (and in any event on the Agreement Date), Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds (A) the License Consideration to the Company to the bank account designated by the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Agreement Date and (B) the Deposited Amount to SoftBank to the bank account designated by SoftBank at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Agreement Date. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall deliver to each other duly executed copies of the Framework Agreement.

(ii) At or promptly following the Closing (and in any event on the Closing Date), Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds the applicable Pro Rata Share of the Closing Cash Consideration to each Seller in accordance with Section 1.1(a) and as set forth in the Spreadsheet to the applicable bank account designated by SoftBank at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing (the “Seller Bank Accounts”). Receipt of such sum in the Seller Bank Accounts shall be a good and valid discharge by Parent of its obligation to make such payments.

(iii) At or promptly following the Closing (and in any event on the Closing Date), Parent shall cause to be issued to each Seller the applicable Pro Rata Share of the Closing Stock Consideration in accordance with Section 1.1(a) and as set forth in the Spreadsheet.

 

3

(iv) At the Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to Parent (A) stock transfer forms duly executed by each Seller transferring the Company Shares held by such Seller to, and into the name of, Parent, or at Parent’s direction, Acquirer, together with share certificates in respect of the Company Shares, and (B) an irrevocable power of attorney in the form set out in Exhibit I, executed by each Seller in favor of Parent, or at Parent’s direction, Acquirer, in respect of the rights attaching to the Company Shares.

(v) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep effective, as soon as practicable following the Closing, and in any event not more than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, a registration statement in accordance with the Investor Rights Agreement permitting the resale of all of the shares of Parent Stock constituting the Closing Stock Consideration pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.

(vi) As soon as practicable following the Closing (and in any event within sixty (60) days following the Closing), Parent shall pay or cause one of its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to pay the Equity Plan Payments to the applicable Equity Plan Participants through the relevant entity’s payroll provider, in each case net of withholding and/or deductions, as applicable.

(b) Escrow Fund. At or promptly following the Closing (and in any event on the Closing Date), Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent. Subject to Section 9.2, the Escrow Fund shall constitute partial security for the benefit of Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) with respect to any indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under Article IX, and shall be held and distributed in accordance with Section 9.1. The Sellers shall be treated as the owners of the Escrow Fund (and related interest and earnings) for income Tax purposes until such amounts are released.

1.3 Contingent Consideration.

(a) Revenue Earnout. An earnout may be earned by the Sellers pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 1.3(a) and, if earned, shall be paid by Parent to the Sellers following the Earnout Period as provided for in this Section 1.3 (such earnout, the “Revenue Earnout”):

(i) in the event that Revenue during the Earnout Period is equal to or exceeds the Revenue Target, then the Revenue Earnout shall be an amount equal to the Revenue Consideration;

(ii) in the event that Revenue during the Earnout Period exceeds the Revenue Floor, but is less than the Revenue Target, then the Revenue Earnout shall be an amount equal to the Revenue Percentage of the Revenue Consideration; and

(iii) in the event that Revenue during the Earnout Period is less than or equal to the Revenue Floor, then no Revenue Earnout shall be earned hereunder and no amount of Revenue Consideration shall be payable hereunder; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall more than one payment of the Revenue Earnout be made pursuant to either Section 1.3(a)(i) or Section 1.3(a)(ii).

 

4

(b) EBITDA Earnout. An earnout may be earned by the Sellers pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 1.3(b), and, if earned, shall be paid by Parent to the Sellers following the Earnout Period as provided for in this Section 1.3 (such earnout, the “EBITDA Earnout” and, together with the Revenue Earnout, the “Earnouts”):

(i) in the event that EBITDA during the Earnout Period is equal to or exceeds the EBITDA Target, then the EBITDA Earnout shall be amount equal to the EBITDA Consideration;

(ii) in the event that EBITDA during the Earnout Period exceeds the EBITDA Floor, but is less than the EBITDA Target, then the EBITDA Earnout shall be an amount equal to the EBITDA Percentage of the EBITDA Consideration; and

(iii) in the event that EBITDA during the Earnout Period is less than or equal to the EBITDA Floor, then no EBITDA Earnout shall be earned hereunder and no amount of EBITDA Consideration shall be payable hereunder, provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall more than one payment of the EBITDA Earnout be made pursuant to either Section 1.3(b)(i) or Section 1.3(b)(ii).

(c) Earnout Statements; Disputes.

(i) Each of Parent and the Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to prepare and deliver to Parent and the Sellers, after March 31, 2022 in a manner and within a timeline consistent with the Company’s past practice (but in any event no later than September 30, 2022) the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Earnout Period audited by Deloitte, or such other audit firm of international repute agreed between Parent and the Sellers (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), including a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries and consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and changes in cash flow of the Company and its Subsidiaries, setting forth in each case in comparative form, the corresponding figures from the previous financial year, in each case prepared in accordance with the Transaction Principles (the “Earnout Financial Statements”). Within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Earnout Financial Statements, the Earnout Party shall deliver to the Non-Earnout Party a statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, the Earnout Party’s good faith calculation of Revenue, EBITDA and the Earnout earned, if any, pursuant to this Section 1.3, together with all reasonable supporting schedules for the foregoing (collectively, the “Earnout Statement”). Each of EBITDA, Revenue and any Earnout to be reflected or set forth in the Earnout Financial Statements or in the Earnout Statement shall be calculated in accordance with the Transaction Principles as set forth on Exhibit J attached hereto (the “Sample Earnout Statement”).

(ii) During the thirty (30) day period (“Earnout Review Period”) following the Non-Earnout Party’s receipt of the Earnout Statement, (A) in furtherance of and without limiting the generality of Section 6.7, the Non-Earnout Party and its Representatives shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers and other documents), employees (involved in the

 

5

preparation of the Earnout Statement, if any), and supporting data of the Earnout Party (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and its and their independent auditors used in the preparation of the Earnout Statement for purposes of their review of the Earnout Statement (provided, that, the Non-Earnout Party and its Representatives, including their independent auditors, shall have executed all customary release letters reasonably requested by the Earnout Party’s independent auditors in connection therewith), (B) the Earnout Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Non-Earnout Party and its Representatives in connection with the review of the Earnout Statement as is reasonably requested by the Non-Earnout Party, and (C) the Non-Earnout Party may dispute the amounts reflected on the line items of the Earnout Statement on the basis that such item does not reflect, or has not been made in a manner consistent with, the provisions of this Section 1.3; provided, however, that, the Non-Earnout Party shall notify the Earnout Party in writing of each disputed item, and specify the amount thereof in dispute and the specific basis therefor, within the Earnout Review Period. Any notice of disputed items shall (x) specify in reasonable detail, to the extent then known, the nature of any disagreement so asserted (with reasonable supporting documentation) and (y) specify, to the extent then known, the amount that the Non-Earnout Party reasonably believes is the correct Revenue, EBITDA or Earnout amount, as applicable, based on the disagreements set forth in the notice of disputed items, including a reasonably detailed description of the adjustments applied to the Earnout Statement in calculating such amounts. The Non-Earnout Party shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Earnout Statement not so objected to in a notice of disputed items delivered within the Earnout Review Period, and the failure by the Non-Earnout Party to provide a notice of disputed items to the Earnout Party within the Earnout Review Period will constitute the Non-Earnout Party’s acceptance of all of the items in the Earnout Statement and the Earnout Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties as the final Earnout Statement.

(iii) If a notice of disputed items shall be validly delivered pursuant to Section 1.3(c)(ii), the parties shall, during the thirty (30) days following the date of such delivery (the “Earnout Resolution Period”), negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed items. During the Earnout Resolution Period, the Earnout Party and its Representatives (including its independent auditors) shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to the working papers of the Non-Earnout Party and its independent auditors relating to the notice of disputed items (provided, that, the Earnout Party and its Representatives, including its independent auditors, have executed all customary release letters reasonably requested by the Non-Earnout Party’s independent auditors in connection therewith). To the extent the disputed items are so resolved in writing within the Earnout Resolution Period, then the Earnout Statement, as revised to incorporate such changes as have been agreed between the Sellers and Parent, shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties as the final Earnout Statement.

(iv) If the parties are unable to reach agreement by the end of the Earnout Resolution Period, notwithstanding the provision in Section 10.12 with respect to applicable substantive law, the parties shall refer all unresolved disputed items to the Arbitration Panel for arbitration to be conducted pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.3(c)(iv) and Section 9.6(c). The parties shall instruct the Arbitration Panel to make a determination with respect to each unresolved disputed item within sixty (60) days

 

6

after its engagement by the Sellers and Parent to resolve such disputed items, which determination shall be made in accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 1.3(c)(iv). The Arbitration Panel shall make its determination solely (A) on the documentation submitted by, and a single presentation (any such documentation or presentation must be provided to the other party prior to its submission or presentation to the Arbitration Panel) made by each of the Sellers and Parent and (B) on the definitions of this Section 1.3 and the related defined terms in this Agreement. The parties shall instruct the Arbitration Panel to deliver to the Sellers and Parent, within such sixty (60) day period, a written report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Earnout Statement and the calculations supporting such adjustments, and any such adjustments must be within the range of values established for such disputed item in the Earnout Statement and the notice of disputed items delivered pursuant to Section 1.3(c)(ii). Such report shall be final, binding on the parties and conclusive on each of the Sellers and Parent, absent manifest errors, and enforceable in a court of law, effective as of the date the Arbitration Panel’s written determination is received by the Sellers and Parent; provided, that, nothing in this Section 1.3 is intended to, and nothing in this Section 1.3 shall be construed or interpreted to, limit any party’s right to obtain any remedies with respect to a breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other parties pursuant to this Agreement. The Arbitration Panel will award to the prevailing party all costs, fees and expenses related to the arbitration, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other professionals incurred by the prevailing party, and judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitration Panel may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If, before the Arbitration Panel renders its determination with respect to the disputed items in accordance with this Section 1.3(c)(iv), (x) the Sellers notify Parent of their agreement with any items in the Earnout Statement previously disputed by the Sellers, (y) Parent notifies the Sellers of its agreement with any items in the Earnout Statement previously disputed by Parent, or (z) the Sellers and Parent otherwise agree to resolution of any such items in writing, then in each case such items as so agreed will be conclusive and binding on the parties immediately upon such notice.

(d) Contingent Consideration Procedures. Following the Earnout Period, Parent shall pay to each Seller such Seller’s Pro Rata Share of the Contingent Consideration (rounded down to the nearest cent or the nearest whole share, as applicable), if any, in the form elected by the Sellers in accordance with Section 1.3(e) and within the time period set forth in Section 1.3(e); provided, that, in the event the amount of the Contingent Consideration is subject to any dispute, any undisputed portion(s) of the Contingent Consideration shall be paid promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after determination of such undisputed portion) by Parent, with any disputed portion(s) paid in installment(s), in each case when and to the extent such amounts are agreed or otherwise determined to be payable in accordance with Section 1.3(c).

(e) Election of Contingent Consideration Form.
