any other Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (v) submit any Acquisition Proposal to the vote of any Seller or (vi) enter into any other transaction or series of transactions the completion of which would impede, interfere with, prevent or delay, or would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or delay, the completion of the Share Purchase or the other Transactions. Each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Sellers will, and will cause their Representatives, acting on their behalf or at their direction, to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to or on the Agreement Date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (B) immediately revoke or withdraw access of any Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any non-public information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal and request from each Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries previously provided to such Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal. If any Representative, whether in his, her or its capacity as such or in any other capacity, takes any action (on the Company’s, any of its Subsidiaries’ or a Seller’s behalf or at their direction) that the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or a Seller is obligated pursuant to this Section 6.1 not to authorize or permit such Representative to take, then the Company and the Seller, respectively, shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have breached this Section 6.1.

(b) The Company and each Seller shall immediately (but in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing after learning of receipt by it (or, to the knowledge of it, by any of its Representatives), of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any other notice that any Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to any of the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person or Persons in connection with, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, other than Parent and its Representatives. Such notice shall describe (A) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request and (B) the identity of the Person or Group making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request. The sender of such notice shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and details of, and any modification to, any such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer and any correspondence or communications related thereto and shall provide to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer and any amendments, correspondence and communications related thereto, if it is in writing, or a reasonable written summary thereof, if it is not in writing. The delivery by the Sellers or the Company to Parent of any notices pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) shall not limit or modify the obligations of the Sellers and the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(a).

6.2 Non-compete; Non-solicitation. In further consideration for the payment of the Aggregate Consideration and in order to protect the value of the Company Shares purchased by Acquirer (including the goodwill inherent in the Company and each Subsidiary as of the Closing), upon the Closing contemplated by this Agreement, each Seller agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, as follows:

(a) Each Seller acknowledges that it has become, and following the date hereof shall continue to be, familiar with Confidential Information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries. Therefore, each Seller agrees that from the Agreement Date through the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Non-compete Period”), it shall not (and shall not take any steps toward or preparations in respect of), directly or indirectly, either for itself or for any other Person, own, manage, control, participate in, invest in, or permit its name to be used by, any Person primarily engaged in and deriving greater than 50% of its revenues from, the design, development, manufacture, production, marketing and sale of semiconductor products and related services intended to compete with either the Arm ISA or X86 ecosystems, including but not limited to semiconductor products and related services related to RISC-V. For purposes of this Section 6.2, the foregoing activities include any direct or indirect interest in any enterprise, whether as a director, partner, agent, representative, stockholder, creditor, or owner; provided, that, the foregoing activities shall not include passive ownership of less than ten percent (10%) of the stock of a publicly held corporation whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter market. During the Non-compete Period, each Seller shall not directly or indirectly through another Person (i) call on, solicit, or service any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation of the Company or any Subsidiary (a “Business Client”) with respect to products or services that have been provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, are currently being provided by the Company or any Subsidiary or which the Company or any Subsidiary is currently in the process of developing; or (ii) encourage, induce or solicit, or attempt to encourage, induce or solicit, any Business Client to cease doing business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Each Seller represents and warrants to Parent that since August 18, 2020, such Seller and its controlled Affiliates have not solicited any Covered Employees in violation of the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and there are currently no outstanding offers of employment from such Seller or its controlled Affiliates to any Covered Employee.

(c) Parent represents and warrants to the Sellers that, since August 18, 2020, Parent and its controlled Affiliates have not solicited any Covered Employees in violation of the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and there are currently no outstanding offers of employment from Parent or its controlled Affiliates to any Covered Employee.

(d) From the Agreement Date through the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, without prior written consent of Parent, each Seller shall not (and shall cause its directly and indirectly controlled Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, induce, solicit or attempt to encourage, induce or solicit any Covered Employee to leave the employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) hire or employ any Covered Employee; provided, however, that, this Section 6.2(d) shall not preclude any Seller or its directly and indirectly controlled Affiliates placing general solicitation, mass advertisement or similar type of broad-based publicly-disseminated solicitation through advertisement or search firms that is not directed specifically toward the Covered Employees.

 

56

(e) From the Agreement Date through the earlier of (i) the later of (1) August 18, 2021, or (2) the termination of this Agreement or (ii) the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Sellers, Parent shall not (and shall cause its directly and indirectly controlled Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly, (x) encourage, induce, solicit or attempt to encourage, induce or solicit any Covered Employee to leave the employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y) hire or employ any Covered Employee; provided, however, that, this Section 6.2(e) shall not preclude Parent or its directly and indirectly controlled Affiliates from placing general solicitation, mass advertisement or similar type of broad-based publicly-disseminated solicitation through advertisement or search firms that is not directed specifically toward the Covered Employees.

(f) Each party acknowledges and represents that: (i) sufficient consideration has been given by each party to this Agreement to the other as it relates hereto; (ii) such party has consulted with independent legal counsel regarding its rights and obligations under this Section 6.2; (iii) such party fully understands the terms and conditions contained herein; (iv) the scope of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries is independent of location (such that it is not practical to limit the restrictions contained in this Section 6.2 to a specified country, city or part thereof); (v) the restrictions and agreements in this Section 6.2 are reasonable in all respects and necessary for the protection of the parties, and their Confidential Information and goodwill and that, without such protection, the parties’ employees, customer and client relationships and competitive advantage would be materially adversely affected; and (vi) the agreements in this Section 6.2 are an essential inducement to the parties to enter into this Agreement and they are in addition to, rather than in lieu of, any similar or related covenants to which the parties are bound.

(g) If at any time a court or arbitrator’s award holds that the restrictions in this Section 6.2 are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area. The parties hereto agree that any breach of the provisions contained in this Section 6.2 will result in serious and irreparable injury and therefore money damages would not be an adequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provisions of this Section 6.2 that is continuing, the Company, Sellers, Parent and their respective successors and assigns and any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security). In addition, in the event of a breach or violation by any party of this Section 6.2, the Non-compete Period shall be tolled until such breach or violation has been duly cured.

6.3 Confidentiality; Public Disclosure.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent, the Sellers and the Company have previously executed a non-disclosure agreement, dated as of May 21, 2020 as amended on August 18, 2020 and a clean team agreement, dated as of August 6, 2020 (collectively, the “Confidentiality Agreement”), which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. At no time shall any party hereto disclose any of the terms of this Agreement (including the economic terms) or any non-public information about a party hereto to any other Person without the prior written consent of the party hereto about which such non-public information

 

57

relates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, a party hereto shall be permitted to disclose any and all terms to its financial, tax and legal advisors (each of whom is subject to a similar obligation of confidentiality), and to the extent necessary or advisable in compliance with Applicable Law and the rules of any applicable stock exchange (including Nasdaq and Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc.). With respect to the Sellers, as used in the Confidentiality Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” shall also include information relating to the Share Purchase or this Agreement received by the Sellers after the Closing or relating to the period after the Closing.

(b) Parent and the Sellers have agreed upon the initial joint press release and other public communications with respect to the execution of this Agreement, and will issue such press release and public communications promptly following the execution of this Agreement (the “Joint Communications”). Other than the Joint Communications, the Sellers and the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to, issue any press release or other public communications relating to the terms of this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior written approval of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (i) the Sellers determine after consultation with outside counsel that it is required by Applicable Law (in which event written notice to that effect shall be first delivered to Parent prior to any such disclosure), (ii) that it consists solely of information previously disclosed in all material respects in previous press releases and public communications in compliance with this Section 6.3(b) or (iii) except as reasonably necessary for the Sellers and the Company to obtain the consents and approvals of Third Parties contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, each of SoftBank and Parent may make such public communications regarding this Agreement or the Transactions as such party may determine (A) is reasonably appropriate to comply with Applicable Law, or with the rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange or Nasdaq; (B) that consist solely of information previously disclosed in all material respects in previous press releases and public communications in compliance with this Section 6.3(b); (C) solely with respect to Parent, are reasonably appropriate in connection with the regulatory approval process, except, in each case subject to prior consultation with the Sellers in accordance with Section 6.4(g); (D) are in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in all material respects in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Sellers in compliance with this Section 6.3(b) and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the other parties, this Agreement or the Transactions. Furthermore, Parent may make such public communications as it determines reasonably appropriate subject to prior consultation with SoftBank and compliance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Parent shall pay any fees associated with the Regulatory Filings.

 

59

(d) If any Legal Proceeding is instituted challenging the Transactions as in violation of any Antitrust Law, the parties shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to support one another in contesting and resisting any such action, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other governmental Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts consummation of the Transactions, unless Parent, after good faith consultation with the Sellers, concludes that litigation is not the best strategy for securing the Regulatory Approvals.

(e) In furtherance to and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent, Acquirer, the Sellers and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all lawful actions necessary to obtain the Regulatory Approvals of the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) in connection therewith in order for the parties to consummate the Transactions prior to the Termination Date (as the same may be extended). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is expressly understood and agreed that Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be under no obligation to (i) propose, negotiate, commit to, and/or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, transfer, license, disposition, or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) their assets, properties, or businesses or any assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement in order to avoid the entry of any lawful decree, judgment, injunction (permanent or preliminary), or any other lawful Order that would make the Transactions unlawful or would otherwise materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) terminate, modify, or assign existing relationships, Contracts, or obligations relating to any assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) change or modify any course of conduct regarding future operations of the assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement (any one of the foregoing, a “Remedy”), in each case except as set forth on Schedule 6.4(e) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Neither Parent nor the Sellers shall be required to (and the Sellers and its Affiliates shall not, without Parent’s prior consent) agree to any term or take or omit to take any action in connection with obtaining the approval of any Governmental Entity that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Share Purchase.

(f) To the extent requested by Parent, the Sellers and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, make or enter into any Remedies, or any other actions reasonably determined by Parent, in each case as necessary to obtain the Regulatory Approvals of the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) in connection therewith in order for the parties to consummate the Transactions; provided, that, (I) the Sellers, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not enter into or make any such Remedies except as and to the extent requested in writing by Parent, (II) no party shall be required pursuant to the foregoing to commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Share Purchase, and (III) the Sellers shall not be required pursuant to the foregoing to commit to or effect any material action or Remedy that are not limited exclusively in scope to the business of the Company.

Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, (i) Parent shall have the ultimate right (A) to determine strategy and direct all matters with any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions following consultation with the Sellers and (B) to review in advance, and direct the revision or submission of, any material communication (whether to be delivered verbally or in writing), filing, application, notification or document to be made by or submitted by the Sellers or the Company to any Governmental Entity under or relating to the Transactions, (ii) the Sellers shall have the right, to the extent feasible, to review in advance, any material communication (whether to be delivered verbally or in writing), filing, application, notification or document to be made by or submitted by Parent to any Governmental Entity under or relating to the Transactions and Parent shall consider in good faith the views of the Sellers with respect to such filings, (iii) the Sellers and the Company shall cooperate fully with Parent with respect to the strategy and direction of all matters related to Regulatory Filings and (iv) to the extent feasible, Parent shall consult with the Sellers and consider in good faith the views of the Sellers with respect to the strategy and direction of these matters, including considering in good faith the Sellers’ and the Company’s proposed communications, filings, applications, notifications or other documents.

If the Sellers, the Company or any of their Affiliates receive any formal or informal request for supplemental information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to any of the Transactions, then the Sellers shall, following consultation with Parent, to the extent feasible, make or cause to be made, a response in compliance with such request (subject to Parent’s right to review, revise and approve any such material response in advance as set out above). The Sellers, the Company and their Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (A) have any substantive contact or communication with any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions or permit any of the Sellers’ or the Company’s Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions unless the Sellers consult with and receive approval of Parent in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, grant Parent the opportunity to attend and lead the discussions at such contact, communication or meeting or (B) proffer, make proposals, negotiate, execute, carry out or submit to any agreements or Orders providing for any actions that would constitute an Remedy; provided, that, the Sellers shall, if directed by Parent, agree to any such action pursuant to Section 6.4(f) that is limited in scope to the business of the Company and conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions. Parent shall not have any substantive contact or communication with any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions or permit any of Parent’s Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions unless, to the extent feasible, Parent provides notice to the Sellers in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, grants Sellers the opportunity to participate in such communication or attend such meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the other (or the other’s respective advisors) upon request copies of all correspondence, white papers and similar submissions between such party and any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Company will and will procure that its Subsidiaries shall comply with all obligations it has to inform or consult with any such Persons regarding the Transactions, and Parent, Acquirer and their Affiliates will provide such information as is reasonably requested by the Company and necessary or desirable for the Company or its Subsidiaries to comply with all such information or consultation obligations.

(b) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall terminate the employment of each U.S. Employee for all purposes contingent upon and effective as of the Closing, and pay in full to the U.S. Employees any and all compensation and benefits, including, without limitation, base salary, wages, bonuses, commissions and other forms of incentive compensation, vacation and paid-time-off and other employee benefits (except, in the case of tax-qualified employee benefits, to the extent vested and payable in a subsequent years in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan), in each case, that have been earned or accrued, as applicable, through the Closing Date (the “Accrued Amounts” and all such Accrued Amounts consisting of vacation, the “U.S. Accrued PTO”). The U.S. Accrued PTO shall be paid by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (in accordance with Applicable Law), following the Cash Sweep calculated in accordance with Section 6.9(c). For the avoidance of doubt, payment of the U.S. Accrued PTO is not a Closing Cash Use for purposes of Section 6.9(c).

(c) Subject to Applicable Law, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries shall mutually cooperate with respect to the retention of Company Employees through and after the Closing Date and with respect to assisting Parent and its Subsidiaries in making offers to U.S. Employees. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent information related to the Company Employees and Company Employee Plans that is reasonably requested by Parent and necessary or desirable for Parent to integrate the Continuing Employees into a combined business with Parent following the Closing, in each case subject to Applicable Law.

 

66

(d) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and except as otherwise required by Applicable Law or by collective bargaining agreement, works council arrangement or other labor union Contract, Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with (i) annual total target compensation that is substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the annual total target compensation (taking into account base salary or wages and recurring cash and equity incentive opportunities) that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) defined contribution retirement (401(k)), health and welfare benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, either (A) to those provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent and Parent’s Affiliates, or (B) to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

(e) Parent agrees that, from and after the Closing, Parent shall and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to grant each Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and any predecessors thereto) prior to the Closing for eligibility and vesting purposes for purposes of statutory employee benefit and severance plans, agreements, arrangements, programs and policies established or maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates on or after the Closing (to the same extent as such credit was recognized prior to the Closing under comparable Company Employee Plans), except where granting such credit would result in a duplication of benefits.

(f) In addition, Parent hereby agrees that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any medical or welfare benefit plan or program maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates on or after the Closing in which the Continuing Employees participate (the “New Plans”) to the extent waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) under the corresponding Company Employee Plan as of the Closing and (ii) cause any deductible, co-insurance and out-of-pocket covered expenses paid on or before the date of initial participation by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be credited for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the date of initial participation under such New Plans in the year of initial participation (to the same extent such credit would have been given under comparable Company Employee Plans prior to the Closing).

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including Sections 6.10, 6.11, 6.12 and 6.13) shall, or shall be construed so as to, (i) prevent or restrict in any way the right of Parent or Acquirer to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any employee, consultant, director or other service provider (or to cause any of the foregoing actions) at any time following the Closing, or to change (or cause the change of) the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other compensation or terms or conditions of employment or service of any such employee, consultant, director or other service provider at any time following the Closing, (ii) constitute an amendment or modification of any Company Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan, (iii) create any third-party rights in any such current or former employee, consultant, director or other service provider (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof), (iv) obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to adopt or maintain any particular plan or program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time or prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates from modifying or terminating any such plan, program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time, or (v) limit or modify the obligations of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under Applicable Law or any applicable collective bargaining agreement, works council arrangement or other labor union Contract.

 

67

6.11 Amendment and Termination of Certain Company Employee Plans.

(a) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall procure that (i) the Board (or an applicable committee thereof) amends (A) the Company Equity Plans to the extent necessary (taking into account any expected lapse of Awards granted thereunder and/or any cash election) to ensure that all Awards can be satisfied in cash at Closing, and (B) the French Sub-Plan, such that rule 5 (Death of a Participant) of the French Sub-Plan shall cease to have effect and any heir of a deceased French Sub-Plan Participant shall not be entitled to make a Request (as defined in rule 5.1 of the French Sub-Plan), and (ii) the Board (or an applicable committee thereof) determines that all Awards will be satisfied in cash at the Closing. If, on or after the Agreement Date but prior to amendment of the French Sub-Plan in accordance with (B) above, a deceased French Sub-Plan Participant’s heir makes a Request, subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall take all actions necessary, desirable or reasonably requested by Acquirer to ensure that any Ordinary A Shares issued pursuant to a Request are acquired by the Company prior to the Closing in accordance with the Organizational Documents. Effective as of the Closing (but without prejudice to the payment by the Company of the Closing Employee Cash Plan Payments and the Equity Plan Payments), the Company or its Subsidiaries shall terminate the Annual Bonus Plan, the Exceptional Outcome Award Policy, the Partnership Bonus & Performance Accelerator Scheme, the Launch Award Scheme, the All-Employee Plan 2019, the French Sub-Plan to the All-Employee Plan 2019, the Executive IPO Plan 2019 (without payment of any Awards thereunder) and the Company EC Sale Plan, in each case to the extent that any such Company Employee Plan does not terminate automatically as of the Closing pursuant to its terms.

(b) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall terminate all Company Employee Plans intended to qualify as cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code but such termination may be contingent on consummation of the Transactions.

(c) The Company shall provide Parent with evidence (i) of the amendment of the Company Equity Plans and termination of the Company Employee Plans in accordance with this Section 6.11 pursuant to resolutions of the Board (or an applicable committee thereof), and (ii) that the Company or its Subsidiaries have taken all other actions (including providing all notices and obtaining all consents) that are necessary, desirable or reasonably requested by Acquirer to accomplish the termination of such plans. The Company shall consult with Parent in respect of the form and substance of any such resolutions, notices and consents and consider in good faith all amendments or modifications reasonably required or requested by Parent.

6.12 Post-Closing RSU Awards. Following the Closing, Parent shall grant restricted stock units covering Parent Stock (“Parent RSUs”) with an aggregate grant-date value not to exceed $1,500,000,000 to certain Continuing Employees (subject to such Continuing Employees’ continued employment with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries through the grant date), pursuant to Parent’s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Parent Equity Plan”) and a restricted stock unit award agreement between Parent and each such Continuing Employee (together with the Parent Equity Plan, the “Parent RSU Documents”). The Parent RSUs shall be allocated among the Continuing Employees as mutually agreed between the Company and Parent, and shall be subject to the vesting and other terms and conditions set forth in the Parent RSU Documents.

(c) The Sellers shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Ordinary Course with respect to such items, except as required by Applicable Law.

(g) Tax Contests.

(i) Parent, Acquirer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sellers and their Affiliates, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such party of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for which the other party would reasonably be expected to be responsible under this Agreement (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a “Tax Matter”). Any failure to so notify the other party of any Tax Matter shall not relieve such other party of any liability with respect to such Tax Matters except to the extent such party was actually and materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

(ii) Parent (and its Affiliates) shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Matters; provided, that, if a Tax Matter relates to Taxes for which a Seller is responsible pursuant to this Agreement (i) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to defend such Tax Matter diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax Matter, (ii) the Sellers shall have the right to fully participate (at their sole cost and expense) in the conduct of such Tax Matter at all administrative, appellate and other dispute resolution stages, (iii) Parent shall keep the Sellers reasonably informed and consult in good faith with the Sellers with respect to any material issue relating to such Tax Matter, (iv) Parent shall provide or forward all written communications from the relevant Tax Authority to the Sellers and offer the Sellers an opportunity to comment on any written materials in connection with such Tax Matter prior to such materials being furnished or submitted and shall consider any such comments in good faith, (v) Parent shall offer the Sellers an opportunity to participate in any phone conversations or meetings with the relevant Tax Authority and (v) Parent shall not settle such Tax Matter without the consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

71

(iii) In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 6.14(g) and Section 9.7, the provisions of this Section 6.14(g) shall control.

(h) The Company shall, upon Parent’s reasonable request, cooperate in good faith and to (i) make any entity classification election pursuant to the Treasury Regulations under Section 7701 of the Code in respect of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company at such time and pursuant to such documentation provided by Parent, and (ii) undertake any other internal restructuring of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as specified by Parent in writing; provided, however, that (i) such entity classification election shall have an effective date no earlier than the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 and no later than one day prior to the Closing Date (ii) any Taxes and out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such actions or transactions other than pursuant to the Reorganizations shall be promptly paid or reimbursed by Parent and (iii) the Company shall not be required to file any such election prior to the Closing Date. At the reasonable request of Parent, the Sellers shall provide such forms or other documentation, including after the Closing Date, as required by Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c)(2).

(i) The Sellers shall be entitled to any cash refunds of any Taxes actually received for which the Sellers are responsible under this Agreement (net of any Tax or regulatory cost arising as a result thereof, any cost incurred in preparing any claim for such refund and any amount of such cash that is subject to any regulatory restriction on its distribution), except to the extent that (i) such refund was reflected as an asset in the Company Closing Financial Certificate or (ii) such refund is attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute (including a net operating loss, net capital loss, foreign tax credit, or research and development credit) arising in a tax period other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the carryback of such Tax attribute does not reduce the amount of any refund that would otherwise be received by the Sellers. Any such refunds of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between the Sellers and Parent in accordance with the principles set forth in Section 6.14(f). In the event that Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) receives such a refund to which the Sellers are entitled pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.14(m), Parent shall pay or cause to be paid such amounts (including any interest paid thereon) to the Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares within ten (10) days of the receipt of the refund.

(j) If either Parent or the Sellers are or become aware of any fact or circumstance that such party may reasonably expect would cause the Share Purchase to not qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment at the Closing Date, then such party shall promptly notify the other parties. The Company and the Sellers agree to execute certificates containing reasonably requested representations, assumptions and undertakings at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by Tax counsel of Parent that are in form and substance acceptable to Parent in connection with the Intended Tax Treatment. The parties agree to treat and report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for all United States federal and applicable state, local and non-United States income Tax purposes (including on all applicable Tax Returns), in accordance with the Intended Tax Treatment, except upon a contrary final determination by an applicable Tax Authority or as otherwise required by applicable non-United States Tax law.

 

72

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent in its sole and absolute discretion shall be permitted to (but shall have no obligation to) make or cause any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to make elections under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Share Purchase. The Sellers shall cooperate in good faith with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) with any assistance reasonably requested by Parent in connection with making such elections with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries. In the event of a statutory change in Law to Section 338 of the Code affecting the calculation of Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries which, based on documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and provided by the Sellers, would have a materially adverse impact on the Sellers, Parent agrees to consult with the Sellers, and consider the consequences of any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Share Purchase under this Agreement.

(l) Post-Closing Actions. Except as required by Applicable Law or in the Ordinary Course (as determined, in each case, in good faith following consultation with the Sellers), without the prior written consent of the Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), in each case to the extent such action would reasonably be expected to materially increase Taxes for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), to: (i) cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action on the Closing Date after the Closing outside of the Ordinary Course (other than actions contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) amend any Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) make any Tax election (other than any election under Section 338 of the Code for the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Share Purchase or any election described under Section 6.14(h)) with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, which Tax election would be effective for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) voluntarily approach any Tax Authority on or after the Closing Date with respect to any Tax position taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries on a Tax Return solely with respect to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or (v) change any annual Tax accounting period or adopt or change any material Tax accounting method, in each case, with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(m) The Sellers shall provide any reasonably requested Code Section 1445 or Code Section 1446(f) certificates with respect to any Subsidiary of the Company taking into account transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(n) The Company and the Sellers shall, upon Parent’s reasonable request, cooperate in good faith with Parent to determine whether the Company is a “passive foreign investment company” within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code for the taxable year including the Closing Date (determined as if the taxable year of the Company ended on the Closing Date) and provide such reasonable representations and documentation as Parent may request with respect to such determination.

 

73

6.15 280G Shareholder Approval. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent will provide to the Company details regarding any payments from Parent that could constitute “parachute payments” (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) in connection with the Transactions. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing), the Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to initiation of the 280G Shareholder Approval process, a Parachute Payment Waiver from each “disqualified individual” (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) who may receive any payments or benefits that could constitute “parachute payments” (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) in connection with the Transactions. Promptly following the delivery of the Parachute Payment Waivers to Parent (but in no event less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing), the Company shall submit to the Sellers for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent and in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code), by such number of holders of the Sellers as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute “parachute payments” pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (“Section 280G Payments”), such that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent notification and documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent that (i) a vote of the holders of Company Shares was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite shareholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the shareholder vote (the “280G Shareholder Approval”) or (ii) that the 280G Shareholder Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the Parachute Payment Waivers that were executed by the affected individuals prior to the vote of the holders of Company Shares pursuant to this Section 6.15. The form of the waiver, the disclosure statement, and the calculations related to the foregoing shall be subject to advance review and approval by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(the “Separation”), and (ii) the Sellers and the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the completion of the ISG Separation and the POU Termination Date (but, in any event, prior to the Closing), cause the distribution of the equity interests of Arm Cloud Services Limited and Treasure Data Inc. to the Sellers (the “Distribution”); provided, however, that the Sellers and the Company shall be permitted to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Treasure Data Inc. to a Third Party purchaser prior to the Distribution so long as (x) the Sellers and the Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to review and comment on the definitive documentation related to any such sale, transfer or disposition and (y) the Sellers and the Company shall not enter into any Contract or commitment in respect of any such sale, transfer or disposition with a Third Party purchaser without the prior written consent of

 

74

Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (any sale, transfer or disposition of Treasure Data Inc. in compliance with clauses (x) and (y) of this proviso being an “Approved TD Sale”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Separation and the Distribution shall constitute the ISG Reorganization.

(b) The ISG Reorganization shall be implemented and consummated on terms that are in substantial conformity with the terms of one or more of the following templates (as applicable): (i) the form business and asset purchase deed, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit M-1, (ii) the form share purchase agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit M-2, (iii) the form transitional services agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit N, (iv) the intellectual property license agreements, in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit O-1, and (v) the form assignment of intellectual property rights, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit O-2 (collectively, with all other forms or agreements approved by the Sellers and Parent, the “ISG Reorganization Documents”); provided, however, that, the Sellers may make reasonable modifications to the ISG Reorganization Documents, the ISG Reorganization Plan or the ISG Reorganization, and/or implement the ISG Reorganization on terms that are not in conformity with the terms of the ISG Reorganization Documents, with the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

The Sellers and the Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to review and comment on the definitive documentation related to the ISG Reorganization prior to the implementation, execution or delivery thereof, but only to the extent that the terms of the definitive documentation are different from the terms of the ISG Reorganization Documents. The Sellers and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), take any action or step that is inconsistent with the ISG Reorganization Plan in any material respect. The Sellers and the Company shall, upon request by Parent, furnish Parent with all information reasonably requested in connection with the ISG Reorganization.

(d) Following the Distribution, the Sellers shall be free to keep, sell, transfer, dispose of, wind down or do otherwise with respect to the ISG Business; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the entities, businesses, assets, liabilities or employees of the ISG Business will be owned, held, assumed or employed, as applicable, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the ISG Business, but other than for an Approved TD Sale, (i) during the period from the Agreement Date and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Distribution, none of the Sellers, the Company or its Subsidiaries will, and none of them will authorize, direct or permit any of their respective Representatives, acting on their behalf or at their direction, to directly or indirectly conduct any process or other solicitation for the sale, transfer or other disposal of the ISG Business, or enter into or participate in any negotiations regarding, or deliver or make available to any Person any non-public information with respect to any, offer, proposal, Contract or other arrangement contemplating or otherwise relating to the sale, transfer or other disposal of the ISG Business, and (ii) following the Distribution, the Sellers shall at all times be permitted to

 

75

conduct any sale process or other action contemplated in the preceding clause (i) so long as such conducted in a manner that is not reasonably expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or delay the completion of the Share Purchase. Following the Distribution, none of Parent, Acquirer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide any assistance or cooperation or otherwise be bound by any obligations or Contracts with respect to any sale, transfer or disposal to a Third Party purchaser, except, in the case of an obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, pursuant to an Approved TD Sale, the ISG Reorganization Documents or as otherwise agreed by Parent in writing in its sole discretion.

(e) During the Interim Period, the Sellers and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain distinct books, records and accounting and financial information of the ISG Business and the Business.

(f) The Sellers shall be responsible for and shall pay or cause to be paid in full, prior to the Closing and the Cash Sweep, all third-party fees, costs, expenses, payments and expenditures arising out of or related to the ISG Reorganization, the ISG Reorganization Documents and any other agreement or document contemplated thereby, and the implementation or completion thereof, including any termination, severance, notice or redundancy payments payable to Company Employees or other service providers, all termination fees, penalties and similar payments upon the termination of any Contracts with vendors, real estate leases and all other contractual arrangements, and any related fees, costs, expenses, Taxes, payments and expenditures of legal counsel, accountants and other advisors.

(ii) the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Parent Indemnified Person against any Damages pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii)(A) of Section 9.2(a) (other than a breach of Special Representations) until the aggregate amount of the Parent Indemnified Persons’ Damages for which the Parent Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification under clauses (i) or (ii)(A) of Section 9.2(a) exceeds $75,000,000 (the “Deductible”), after which the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall be liable for all of the Parent Indemnified Persons’ Damages for which the Parent Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification under clauses (i) or (ii)(A) of Section 9.2(a) (other than a breach of the Special Representations) that are in excess of the Deductible; but, for the avoidance of doubt, only if such excess Damages arise with respect to any claim (or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) that involves Damages in excess of De Minimis Threshold; and

(iii) the total Liability of the Seller Indemnifying Parties for claims under this Article IX shall be limited to (i) the General Liability Cap for any claims for Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i) or (ii)(A) of Section 9.2(a) (other than claims arising out of, resulting from or in connection with any failure of any of the Special Tax Representations or the Special Representations to be true and correct); and (ii) with respect to each Seller, such portion of the Aggregate

 

89

Consideration actually received by such Seller, for all claims for Damages (inclusive of claims described in the preceding clause (i)); provided, that, any limitation of Liability in this Section 9.3(c) shall not apply in the case of fraud or willful breach by or on behalf of the Sellers or the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the total Liability of Parent for any claim under this Article IX shall be limited to $1,000,000,000 for any claims for Damages arising out of or resulting from the matters listed in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.2(b); provided, that, any limitation of Liability in this Section 9.3(d) shall not apply in the case of fraud or willful breach by or on behalf of Parent or Acquirer.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) no Seller Indemnifying Party shall have any right of indemnification, compensation, reimbursement, contribution or right of advancement from Acquirer, Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person (based upon such Seller Indemnifying Party’s position as an equity holder, officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or otherwise) with respect to any Damages claimed by any Parent Indemnified Person or any right of subrogation against the Company with respect to any indemnification, compensation or reimbursement of a Parent Indemnified Person by reason of any of the matters set forth in Section 9.2(a).

(f) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Indemnifying Parties, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified Persons, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any information furnished to, any investigation made by or knowledge of, or any waiver by any of the Indemnified Persons or any of their Representatives.

(g) All Damages shall be calculated net of the amount of any recoveries actually received by an Indemnified Person under any existing insurance policies and contractual indemnification or contribution provisions (in each case, calculated net of any actual collection costs and reserves, expenses, deductibles or premium adjustments or retrospectively rated premiums (as determined in good faith by such Indemnified Person) incurred or paid to procure such recoveries) in respect of any Damages suffered, paid, sustained or incurred by any Indemnified Person. No Indemnified Person shall have any obligation to seek to obtain or continue to pursue any recovery from insurance policies, contractual indemnification or contribution provisions. The foregoing provisions of this Section 9.3(g) shall not in any way limit any Parent Indemnified Person’s right to recover under the Escrow Fund with respect to any Damages or limit any Parent Indemnified Person’s right to submit a claim for indemnification under this Agreement.

(h) The Indemnified Persons’ rights to indemnification contained in this Article IX and Section 10.11(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Persons for monetary damages in connection with the matters described in this Agreement, other than fraud or willful breach, whether such damages arise pursuant to contract, tort or other theory of law; provided, that, nothing in this Section 9.3(h) is intended to, and nothing in this Section 9.3(h) shall be construed or interpreted to, limit any Indemnified Person’s right to equitable remedies or other non-monetary remedies at law, including the right to seek specific performance and/or injunctive relief under Applicable Law, in accordance with Section 10.10 and Section 10.12.

 

90

(i) The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall have no obligation to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Persons for Damages in respect of any liability for Taxes described in Section 9.2(a)(vi)(A) through (F) or claim for breach of any of the Tax Representations, to the extent any such Damages (i) are directly and solely attributable to or arise as a result directly and solely from (a) any breach by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) of any of the covenants set forth in Section 6.14(l), (b) any elections under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Share Purchase except to the extent of any action taken by Sellers, on or prior to the Closing, or the Company, which results in the Share Purchase failing to qualify under the Intended Tax Treatment or (c) any election or transaction undertaken at Parent’s request pursuant to Section 6.14(h), (ii) are solely in respect of Taxes that were taken into account in the calculation of Leakage, (iii) are solely in respect of Post-Closing IP Deferred Tax Liabilities or (iv) that are Taxes that have been specifically identified by the Sellers through documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent as amounts taken into account in determining Pre-Closing Taxes calculated for purposes of and included in Section 6.9(b)(vii) and Seller Transaction Taxes calculated for purposes of and included in Section 6.9(b)(vii).

9.4 Period for Claims. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.4, the period (the “Claims Period”) during which claims may be made: (i) for Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clause (v) of Section 9.2(a) (or otherwise arising out of, resulting from or in connection with Leakage) shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date; (ii) for Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i) or (ii)(A) of Section 9.2(a) (other than with respect to any of the Tax Representations and the Special Representations) or clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 9.2(b) shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Escrow Release Date; and (iii) for Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection all other matters, shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the date that is thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Claims Period for claims for Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with fraud or willful breach by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party shall not be limited.

9.5 Claims.

(a) From time to time during the Claims Period, Parent may deliver to the Sellers or the Sellers may deliver to Parent, one or more certificates signed by any officer of such party (each, a “Claim Certificate”):

(i) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, or in good faith believes that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue, Damages (or that with respect to any Tax Matters, that any Tax Authority may raise such matter in an audit of Parent or Acquirer or the Affiliates of either, that could give rise to Damages);

(ii) stating the amount of such Damages (which, in the case of Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may, if known or estimable, be the maximum amount believed by Parent in good faith to be incurred, paid, reserved, accrued or demanded by a Third Party); and

 

91

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed by Parent) the individual items of such Damages included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such Damages are related if known or estimable.

(b) Such Claim Certificate (i) need only specify such information to the knowledge of such officer of Parent as of the date thereof, (ii) shall not limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person with respect to the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such Claim Certificate and (iii) may be updated and amended from time to time by Parent by delivering any updated or amended Claim Certificate, so long as the delivery of the original Claim Certificate is made within the applicable Claims Period and such update or amendment relates to the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such original Claims Certificate; provided, that, all claims for Damages properly set forth in a Claim Certificate or any update or amendment thereto shall remain outstanding until such claims have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the expiration of such Claims Period. No delay in providing such Claim Certificate within the applicable Claims Period shall affect an Indemnified Person’s rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Sellers or the Indemnifying Parties are materially prejudiced thereby.

9.6 Resolution of Objections to Claims.

(a) If the Sellers (on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties) do not contest, by written notice to Parent, any claim or claims by Parent (on behalf of the Parent Indemnified Persons) made in any Claim Certificate within the thirty (30) day period following receipt of the Claim Certificate, then Parent and the Sellers shall promptly prepare, sign and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to distribute to Parent an amount of cash from the Escrow Fund having a total value equal to the amount of any indemnifiable Damages hereunder corresponding to such claim or claims as set forth in such Claim Certificate. If Parent does not contest, by written notice to the Sellers, any claim or claims by the Sellers (on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Persons) made in any Claim Certificate within the thirty (30) day period following receipt of the Claim Certificate, then Parent shall promptly pay to each Seller such Seller’s Pro Rata Share of the amount of any indemnifiable Damages hereunder corresponding to such claim or claims as set forth in such Claim Certificate, in cash by wire transfer to the Seller Bank Accounts.

(b) If the Sellers (on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties) or Parent object in writing to any claim or claims made by a Parent Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, respectively, in any Claim Certificate within the thirty (30) day period set forth in Section 9.6(a), Parent and the Sellers shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days after the applicable party’s receipt of such written objection to resolve such objection. If Parent and the Sellers shall so agree with respect to a claim by a Parent Indemnified Person, a joint written instruction setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parent and the Sellers and delivered to the Escrow Agent. Upon receipt of such joint written instruction, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent an amount in cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such joint written instruction.

 

92

(c) If no such agreement can be reached during the sixty (60) day period for good faith negotiation set forth in Section 9.6(b), but in any event upon the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, such dispute shall be finally settled by binding arbitration. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. Such arbitration shall be conducted in English in accordance with the CPR Arbitration Procedure (currently in effect) by three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with such rules (the “Arbitration Panel”). Notwithstanding the provision in Section 10.12 with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Section 9.6(c) shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., SECS. 1-16). The Arbitration Panel shall allow such discovery as is appropriate to the purposes of arbitration in accomplishing a fair, speedy and cost-effective resolution of the dispute. The award of arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The Arbitration Panel will award to the prevailing party all costs, fees and expenses related to the arbitration, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other professionals incurred by the prevailing party, and judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitration Panel may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The decision of the Arbitration Panel as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties hereto and the Indemnifying Parties, and Parent shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent an amount in cash from the Escrow Fund equal to any arbitral award in favor of Parent.

(d) Judgment upon any determination of an Arbitration Panel may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 9.6(d), in any suit hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Claim Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the prevailing party unless the Arbitration Panel determines in favor of the Sellers (on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties) with respect to more than one-half of the amount in dispute, in which case the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to be the prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the prevailing party, including attorneys’ fees and costs, reasonably incurred in connection with such suit.

9.7 Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a claim by a Third Party (a “Third-Party Claim”) that Parent in good faith believes may result in a claim for Damages by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person, Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve such Third-Party Claim and the costs and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution (including attorneys’ fees, other professionals’ and experts’ fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Damages for which Parent shall be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder. The Sellers shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege relating to any Indemnified Person, subject to execution by the Sellers of Parent’s (and, if required, such Third Party’s) standard non-disclosure agreement to the extent that such materials contain confidential or propriety information. However, Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine and conduct the defense of any Third-Party Claim and the settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third-Party Claim. Unless otherwise consented to in writing in advance by Parent in its sole discretion, the Sellers and their Affiliates may not participate in any Third-Party Claim or any action related to such Third-Party Claim (including any discussions or negotiations in connection with the settlement, adjustment or compromise thereof). In the event that the Sellers have consented to the amount of any settlement or resolution by Parent of any such claim (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

 

93

conditioned or delayed and which consent shall be deemed to have been given unless the Sellers shall have objected within twenty (20) days after a written request therefor by Parent), or if the Sellers shall have been determined to have unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed its consent to the amount of any such settlement or resolution, the Sellers and Indemnifying Party (a) shall not have any power or authority to object under this Article IX to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement or resolution, (b) shall be deemed to have approved the related Claim Certificate and (iii) shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent an amount in cash from the Escrow Fund equal to the applicable Damages with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

9.8 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The Indemnifying Parties agree to treat (and cause their respective Affiliates to treat) any payment received by the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Article IX as adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.
